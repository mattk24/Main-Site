      <h3>Tae Kwon Do and Shaolin Kung Fu</h3>
      <p class="martial-arts-text">I enjoy Martial Arts it really keeps me going. It teaches you more than just self defense it teaches you a way of life and how to think such as disipline, respect, patience and other life long virtues and it trains not only your body but your mind, spirit, and as well most importantly it teaches you self-control these are the traits of a true martial artist I have studied Tae Kwon Do and I'm a third degree black belt as well as Shaolin Kung Fu right now I'm a blue belt. So I still have a long ways to go Tae means "Hand" in Korean and Kwon means "Foot" while Do means "The Way of" all together means "The Way of Hand and Foot". In Kung Fu however it has various different meanings Kung Fu is a very integrated and diverse system of martial arts in chinese Kung can mean "skillful work" and Fu means "time spent" together meaning "Time Spent at Skillful Work".</p>
